Question 1:
You are analyzing a column of sales numbers.
Write a Python if-else block that checks a number sale = 1500 and prints:

    "High Sale" if it's more than 1000

    "Low Sale" if it's 1000 or less


sales = [1200, 1500, 200, 300, 600, 1600, 2000]

for item in sales:
    if item > 1000:
        print("High Sale")
    else:
        print("Low Sale")


Question 2:
Write a program that takes a sale value and:

    Prints "Low" if it’s less than 500

    Prints "Medium" if it’s between 500 and 1500 (inclusive)

    Prints "High" if it’s more than 1500


sale = 1200

if sale < 500:
    print("Low")
elif sale <= 1500:
    print("Medium")
else:
    print("High")


Question 3:
You’re building a simple tool to classify customer satisfaction based on a score they enter.

Write a program that:

    Asks the user to enter a satisfaction score (between 1 and 5)

    Then prints:

        "Very Dissatisfied" for 1

        "Dissatisfied" for 2

        "Neutral" for 3

        "Satisfied" for 4

        "Very Satisfied" for 5

# Ask the user for input
rating = int(input("Enter a satisfaction rating (1 to 5): "))

# Use if-elif-else to classify the rating
if rating == 1:
    print("Very Dissatisfied")
elif rating == 2:
    print("Dissatisfied")
elif rating == 3:
    print("Neutral")
elif rating == 4:
    print("Satisfied")
elif rating == 5:
    print("Very Satisfied")
else:
    print("Invalid rating")
